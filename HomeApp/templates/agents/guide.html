            <h2>Treat Real Estate As a Business, Not a Hobby</h2>
            <p>
                If you treat your job as a real estate agent more as a hobby than a business, you may tend to be more careless about it.
                Real estate is a business to be taken seriously. After all, it’s about money, and when you’re careless with something that
                involves money, you tend to lose it. Being a real estate agent makes you an independent contractor, and it’s up to you to 
                manage your own business and set your own business model. Remain professional in order to achieve success and remain in a 
                positive light for your current and potential clients

                these connections through follow-ups with clients that you may have sold or purchased a house for in the past, or even someone 
                that you spoke to about potentially working with. Each connection has a value and can be one more step to business success.
